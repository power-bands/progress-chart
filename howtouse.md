# Book Progress Chart Generator
## How to Use This Tool
This tool produces a schedule of completion dates for each chapter in a book. You provide the number of chapters, pages in each chapter, and how many pages per day (PPD) you'll read.
Currently, if the number of pages in a chapter is not evenly divisble by the PPD, the scheduled completion date is rounded up to the next full day. Completion dates are scheduled inclusively beginning at the current date.
## Bullet Journal Users
The resulting chart is designed for transcription into your bullet journal. It includes a few extra columns you might find useful for tracking your progress and referencing related collections:
- Start Column: Mark the date you begin reading the target chapter.
- Finish Column: Mark the date you finish reading the target chapter.
- Duration Column: Mark the number of days you spent reading the target chapter.
- Transcription Column: Mark the page numbers of any transcribed passages you made from the target chapter.
- Vocabulary Column: Mark the page numbers of any vocabulary collections derived from the target chapter.
